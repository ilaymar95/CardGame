# 🃏 CardGame – Python OOP & Unit Testing Project

A command-line based card game built with Python, demonstrating solid Object-Oriented Programming principles and test-driven development using `unittest`.

## 📦 Project Structure

- `card.py` – Defines the `Card` class, representing a single playing card.
- `deck_of_cards.py` – Manages the `DeckOfCards` class, including deck creation, shuffling, and drawing.
- `player.py` – Contains the `Player` class, handling player hands and actions.
- `card_game.py` – Main game logic class that simulates a round-based card game between two players.
- `test_*.py` – Unit tests for each main component.

## 🚀 Features

- Fully modular OOP structure (Card, Deck, Player, Game)
- CLI-based gameplay simulation
- Randomized deck with shuffling and drawing
- Robust edge case handling (e.g., empty deck, insufficient cards)
- 100% unit test coverage for key components
- TDD development approach using Python’s built-in `unittest` library

## 🧪 How to Run Tests

```bash
python -m unittest discover
```

## 🛠 Technologies

- Python 3.x  
- `unittest`  
- `random` module  
- Command Line Interface (CLI)

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Deepen understanding of class relationships and encapsulation
- Practice TDD (Test-Driven Development)
- Handle game logic, state management, and input validation
- Organize a clean and testable Python codebase
